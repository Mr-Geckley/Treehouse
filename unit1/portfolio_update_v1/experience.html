          From the very first time I opened an HTML file in the browser I was in
          love with web development. I instantly felt like a kid again. As I
          continue to learn more about my craft I only fall deeper and deeper in
          love with it. From the ever shifting technologies to the potential to
          create services that change lives - there's no shortage of reasons why
          I love doing what I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's room for everyone on the web and I'm a strong believer in rule
          303: "Those with the means to act have the obligation to do so". To
          me, in the realm of web development this means not arbitrarily
          excluding audiences from the things we build as web developers.
          Specifically, I'm talking about digital accessibility. Accessible
          content and features are not "nice-to-haves", they're the right and
          polite thing to do.

          While I haven't made the transition to working as a UI engineer, I
          have taken some important steps toward making that dream come true.
